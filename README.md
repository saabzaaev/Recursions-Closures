# Recursion
## what is recursion in JavaScript ?
>[!TIP]
> Recursion is a programming pattern or concept embedded in many programming languages, and JavaScript is not left out. It is a feature used in creating a function that keeps calling itself but with a smaller input every consecutive time until the code's desired result from the start is achieved.

* ## A recursive must have condition to stop it colling it self. Otherwise , the function is colled indefinitely.
 
* ## Condition is the way that we can STOP the recursive.
 
* ## Also you can use else to stop it.

## What is closure in JavaScript

>[!TIP]
> A closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access the outer scope of a function. Closure helps in binding a function to its outer boundary and is created automatically whenever a function is created. A block is also treated as a scope since ES6. Since JavaScript is event-driven so closures are useful as it helps to maintain the state between events.
